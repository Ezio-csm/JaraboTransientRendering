Overview
--------

The code compiles to a command line program that can render HDR images of scenes  
stored as obj files. The format of the command line arguments is explained in  
INPUT.md.

* The code uses the CImg library for output HDR images. Thus, while no  
  additional linking or dll is needed for output HDR format, other formats can  
  be used by using additional dlls.
* The code is designed with educational purposes, and therefore is not optimized  
  for speed, but to be the most comprehensive and extendible as possible.
* We will try to update the code with additional features and new goodies  
  periodically; unfortunately, this periodicity might not be as good as we'd  
  like. In any case, stay tuned to the
  [project page](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~ajarabo/pubs/transientSIGA14/code).
